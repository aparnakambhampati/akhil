POM: 
-->it is a design pattern to create object repository for webelements in web browser applications
-->in page object model each and every page consider as one class   and in this class  we find webelements and methods
-->by using this model if any ui changes for any page it's does't required to change any test just we need to change only the code with in the
page objects
-->by using page factory we can initilize webelements by using @findby annotation
-->in this model we have to declare webelements ,initilize webelements and utilize webelements and methods
-->in this model we create three package
-->in one package we used to manage all resable method
-->in another package we used to manage all page objects
-->in another package we used to manage all the test scripts
